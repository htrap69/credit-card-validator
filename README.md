# credit-card-validator
A credit card validator program  that uses Luhn's algorithm is a program that can determine whether a given credit card number is a valid number or not. The program uses Luhn's algorithm, which is a widely used method for validating credit card numbers, to verify the validity of the input number. The program is written in C++ and uses the standard C++ library.

Luhn's algorithm is a simple way to check if the card number is valid or not by performing mathematical operation on it's digits and then checking if the sum is divisible by 10, if yes card is valid otherwise invalid.
